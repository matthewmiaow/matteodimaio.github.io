One of the things that is so refreshing about Yudkowsky's HPMOR is its approach to death.

- death is not bad

Makes onne realise how omniprescent anti-transhumanist strains of thought are in literature in general. Let's nitpick from some blockbusters I've recently seen:

- the eternals
- spipiderman
- gods of eygpt

What's so interesting about this? Well, we can observe these omniprescent trends from literature shaping our conceptions of how the universe works back in reality.

But of course, the universe doesn't run on the same mechanics as critical theory. Death doesn't form a part of the cosmic balance. Humans commiting genocide is not "special" because "without our flaws, we wouldn't be human" as the Eternals would have you believe.

Let's just rephrase that line for a minute.

"Without their  flaws (killing people), killer death robots wouldn't be killer death robots."

No, but they would be morally superior...
