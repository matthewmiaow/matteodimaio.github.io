Introduction
Proponents of the “Tartarian Empire” theory claim that the world’s pre-Modern architecture was the
work of a single, global, technologically-advanced state called Tartaria which was destroyed in the 19th
century due to a “mud flood” and subsequently erased from the history books (Mortice, 2021; Tartaria
Uncovered: AntiquiTech, Tesla, Mud Flood & Beyond!, n.d.; Dunning, 2021). New Zealand based
believers suggest that Dunedin’s 19th century architecture was the work of this Empire (Hypothesis A –
Hb) as opposed to that of British settlers (Hypothesis B – Hb) (The Mysterious Tartarian Buildings of
Dunedin (NZ) – Tartaria Empire Youtube, n.d.). I will evaluate both Ha and Hb with the help of the
SEARCH process (Schick & Vaughn, 2014).
Claim
Much of Dunedin’s pre-Modern architecture was built by a technologically advanced global civilization
called the Tartarian Empire. The downfall of Tartaria was due to a mud-flood, which caused a loss of
technology that prevents us from building new “Tartarian Architecture”–a broad category that lumps
together Beaux Arts, neo/gothic, neo/classical and even Ancient Egyptian buildings—henceforth
referred to as ‘TA’.
Evidence
Proponents of Ha point to the significant presence of TA in Dunedin. For example, the Railway station
(built in 1903), the First Church (1867) or the World’s Fair building (1865, now demolished) all share
various ornate features that are seen as markers of the Tartarian style elsewhere in NZ and the world
(tartaryan, 2019).
YouTuber “King Dave” has questioned how a population of “2000” in 1861 could have sourced the
necessary materials and manpower to build imposing brick architecture (Obeda, 2021, 18:22). He has
also questioned how Dunedin could have had buildings in 1849, only one year after that arrival of
settlers, as well as how early settlers could have built buildings “10 stories high”(Obeda, 2021, 10:26;
Passenger Arrivals at Port Chalmers, New Zealand, 1848-1851, n.d.; Obeda, 2021, 14:47). Tall “spires”
on 19th century buildings are suggested by King Dave to be advanced antenna (Obeda, 2021, 37:09).
The lack of people and the apparent presence of mud surrounding buildings in cityscape photos
of Dunedin in the 1800s has been touted as evidence of a mud-flood disaster (Obeda, 2021, 47:32).
Finally, the whiteness of the sky in these photos is taken as evidence of photographic tampering
by the government to tell an alternate history; perhaps one in which advanced air technology is erased
from the history books (Obeda, 2021, 13:29).
Is it admissible?
This evidence is largely not admissible.
19th century Dunedin architecture conforming to the “Tartarian” style could as easily be
explained by Hb. Dunedin was settled early of the NZ cities, which would explain why it has a large
amount of pre-Modern architecture. Additionally, the exodus North and slowing economic growth after
the Gold Rush ended helps explain why so much of Dunedin’s architecture was not demolished for
newer buildings as it was in other cities (“The Drift to the North,” 1916)
Likewise, the consistency of Dunedin architecture with styles found contemporaneously
overseas can be easily explained by the fact Dunedin was colonised by the British. As Richardson
(1988, pp. 1–2) has written, the architectural design of colonial cities like Dunedin offered a chance for
the British Empire to indicate its cultural influence.
There are also factual errors that discount some evidence. Most importantly, the Otago
population in the 1860s was 27,163 according to the Census, not the 2000s that King Dave mentions
(STATISTICS OF NEW ZEALAND FOR 1861, n.d.). Likewise, none of the photos King Dave
provides actually show 10 story high buildings.
The antenna King Dave points out in photographs are actually spires, a key part of the Gothic
architectural tradition since the Middle Ages (Spire | Architecture | Britannica, n.d.).
The claims of evidence of a mud flood also don’t stand up. As architectural historian Robin
Aitken told the Spinoff, the mud seen in such photos can be explained easily by the use of horses and
the resultant feces. Early photography (in the 1800s) required very long exposures, which meant
moving people were not captured, explaining the empty streets (Lamb, 2017).
Finally, white skies are in fact a common photographic occurrence, relating to high set
exposures in outdoor photography. This is common and is not good evidence of tampering, hence is
inadmissible (axelf, 2012).
Alternate hypothesis
Dunedin was built British settlers over the mid-late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Criteria of adequacy
A section of the wider Tartarian theory is falsifiable in that we could attempt to build TA in the modern
period, proving that we don’t build such buildings because of stylistic concerns, not lacking
technological ability. Indeed, we have actually tested this claim and it has been falsified: The ‘theatre’
building in the Espaces d’Abraxas complex near Paris is in the neoclassical style, for example, and was
built entirely in 1978-83. Hb is falsifiable—if we found remains of advanced Tartarian technology used
to build Dunedin architecture then that would be evidence against Hb. No such evidence has been found
so far.
Neither hypothesis is fruitful.
Both hypotheses have a wide purported scope, as the Tartarian theory purports to explain the
presence of architecture all over the world. Likewise, the British colonial theory also explains the
presence of such architecture all over the world, for example in Shanghai.
Hb is far more simple than Ha. Ha makes a large number of assumptions, for example that the
government has covered up both Tartaria but also the fact of the coverup itself. It posits huge amounts
of hidden rubble from demolished TA, as well as large amounts of missing Tartarian technology. It also
assumes that an advanced world state could have been destroyed by a mud-flood when somehow a less
advanced subsequent government survived. Advanced technology is profitable and thus hard to keep
secret, yet Ha assumes this has been done.
Additionally, proponents of Ha still posit the arrival of British settlers in NZ, just that they found
rather than built the TA. Thus, Hb is more simple as it posits only British settlers, whereas Ha posits both
British settlers and Tartarians.
Finally, Hb is more conservative in that mainstream architectural and engineering theory holds
that such buildings could have been built with the technology of the time. Ha is less conservative in that
it contradicts these established histories.
Conclusion
Elements of Ha are falsifiable; they have been falsified. Hb is falsifiable but has not yet been falsified.
While both hypotheses have a wide scope, Hb is far more simple than Ha. Likewise, Hb is more
conservative than Ha. Paired with the inadmissibility of much of the evidence put forward for Ha, this
gives us good reason to reject Ha and to continue to believe Hb.
