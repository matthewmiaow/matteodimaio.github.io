<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p class="drop-cap">Many workers in the biological sciences—physiologists, psychologists, sociologists—are interested in cybernetics and would like to apply its methods and techniques to their own speciality. Many have, however, been prevented from taking up the subject by an impression that its use must be preceded by a long study of electronics and advanced pure mathematics; for they have formed the impression that cybernetics and these subjects are inseparable.</p>

<p>The author is convinced, however, that this impression is false. The basic ideas of cybernetics can be treated without reference to electronics, and they are fundamentally simple; so although advanced techniques may be necessary for advanced applications, a great deal can be done, especially in the biological sciences, by the use of quite simple techniques, provided they are used with a clear and deep understanding of the principles involved. It is the author’s belief that if the subject is founded in the common-place and well understood, and is then built up carefully, step by step, there is no reason why the worker with only elementary mathematical knowledge should not achieve a complete understanding
of its basic principles. With such an understanding he will then be
able to see exactly what further techniques he will have to learn if
he is to proceed further; and, what is particularly useful, he will be
able to see what techniques he can safely ignore as being irrelevant to his purpose.</p>

<p>The book is intended to provide such an introduction. It starts
from common-place and well-understood concepts, and proceeds,
step by step, to show how these concepts can be made exact, and
how they can be developed until they lead into such subjects as
feedback, stability, regulation, ultrastability, information, coding,
noise, and other cybernetic topics. Throughout the book no
knowledge of mathematics is required beyond elementary algebra; in particular, the arguments nowhere depend on the calculus
(the few references to it can be ignored without harm, for they are
intended only to show how the calculus joins on to the subjects
discussed, if it should be used). The illustrations and examples are
mostly taken from the biological, rather than the physical, sciences. Its overlap with Design for a Brain is small, so that the two
books are almost independent. They are, however, intimately
related, and are best treated as complementary; each will help to
illuminate the other.</p>

<p>It is divided into three parts.</p>
<p>Part I deals with the principles of Mechanism, treating such
matters as its representation by a transformation, what is meant by
“stability”, what is meant by “feedback”, the various forms of
independence that can exist within a mechanism, and how mechanisms can be coupled. It introduces the principles that must be
followed when the system is so large and complex (e.g. brain or
society) that it can be treated only statistically. It introduces also
the case when the system is such that not all of it is accessible to
direct observation—the so-called Black Box theory.</p>
<p>Part II uses the methods developed in Part I to study what is
meant by “information”, and how it is coded when it passes
through a mechanism. It applies these methods to various problems in biology and tries to show something of the wealth of possible applications. It leads into Shannon’s theory; so after reading
this Part the reader will be able to proceed without difficulty to the
study of Shannon’s own work.</p>
<p>Part III deals with mechanism and information as they are used
in biological systems for regulation and control, both in the inborn
systems studied in physiology and in the acquired systems studied
in psychology. It shows how hierarchies of such regulators and
controllers can be built, and how an amplification of regulation is
thereby made possible. It gives a new and altogether simpler
account of the principle of ultrastability. It lays the foundation for
a general theory of complex regulating systems, developing further the ideas of Design for a Brain. Thus, on the one hand it provides an explanation of the outstanding powers of regulation
possessed by the brain, and on the other hand it provides the principles by which a designer may build machines of like power.</p>
<p>Though the book is intended to be an easy introduction, it is not
intended to be merely a chat about cybernetics—it is written for
those who want to work themselves into it, for those who want to
achieve an actual working mastery of the subject. It therefore contains abundant easy exercises, carefully graded, with hints and
explanatory answers, so that the reader, as he progresses, can test his
grasp of what he has read, and can exercise his new intellectual muscles. A few exercises that need a special technique have been marked
thus: *Ex. Their omission will not affect the reader’s progress.</p>
<p>For convenience of reference, the matter has been divided into
sections; all references are to the section, and as these numbers are
shown at the top of every page, finding a section is as simple and
direct as finding a page. The section is shown thus: S.9/14—indicating the fourteenth section in Chapter 9. Figures, Tables, and
Exercises have been numbered within their own sections; thus
Fig. 9/14/2 is the second figure in S.9/14. A simple reference, e.g.
Ex. 4, is used for reference within the same section. Whenever a
word is formally defined it is printed in <b>bold-faced</b> type.</p>
<p>I would like to express my indebtedness to Michael B. Sporn,
who checked all the Answers. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Governors of Barnwood
House and to Dr. G. W. T. H. Fleming for the generous support that
made these researches possible. Though the book covers many topics, these are but means; the end has been throughout to make clear
what principles must be followed when one attempts to restore normal function to a sick organism that is, as a human patient, of fearful complexity. It is my faith that the new understanding may lead
to new and effective treatments, for the need is great.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-new">WHAT IS NEW</h3>

<p>1/1. Cybernetics was defined by Wiener as “the science of control
and communication, in the animal and the machine”—in a word,
as the art of steermanship, and it is to this aspect that the book will
be addressed. Co-ordination, regulation and control will be its
themes, for these are of the greatest biological and practical interest.
We must, therefore, make a study of mechanism; but some
introduction is advisable, for cybernetics treats the subject from a
new, and therefore unusual, angle. Without introduction, Chapter
2 might well seem to be seriously at fault. The new point of view
should be clearly understood, for any unconscious vacillation
between the old and the new is apt to lead to confusion.</p>

<p>1/2. <em id="poc">The peculiarities of cybernetics.</em> Many a book has borne the
title “Theory of Machines”, but it usually contains information
about mechanical things, about levers and cogs. Cybernetics, too,
is a “theory of machines”, but it treats, not things but ways of
behaving. It does not ask “what is this thing?” but “what does it
do?” Thus it is very interested in such a statement as “this variable
is undergoing a simple harmonic oscillation”, and is much less
concerned with whether the variable is the position of a point on
a wheel, or a potential in an electric circuit. It is thus essentially
functional and behaviouristic.
Cybernetics started by being closely associated in many ways
with physics, but it depends in no essential way on the laws of
physics or on the properties of matter. Cybernetics deals with all
forms of behaviour in so far as they are regular, or determinate, or
reproducible. The materiality is irrelevant, and so is the holding or
not of the ordinary laws of physics. (The example given in S.4/15
will make this statement clear.) The truths of cybernetics are not
conditional on their being derived from some other branch of science. Cybernetics has its own foundations. It is partly the aim of
this book to display them clearly.</p>

<p>1/3. Cybernetics stands to the real machine—electronic, mechanical, neural, or economic—much as geometry stands to a real object
in our terrestrial space. There was a time when “geometry” meant
such relationships as could be demonstrated on three-dimensional
objects or in two-dimensional diagrams. The forms provided by
the earth—animal, vegetable, and mineral—were larger in number
and richer in properties than could be provided by elementary
geometry. In those days a form which was suggested by geometry
but which could not be demonstrated in ordinary space was suspect
or inacceptable. Ordinary space dominated geometry.
Today the position is quite different. Geometry exists in its own
right, and by its own strength. It can now treat accurately and
coherently a range of forms and spaces that far exceeds anything
that terrestrial space can provide. Today it is geometry that contains the terrestrial forms, and not vice versa, for the terrestrial
forms are merely special cases in an all-embracing geometry.
The gain achieved by geometry’s development hardly needs to
be pointed out. Geometry now acts as a framework on which all
terrestrial forms can find their natural place, with the relations
between the various forms readily appreciable. With this increased
understanding goes a correspondingly increased power of control.
Cybernetics is similar in its relation to the actual machine. It
takes as its subject-matter the domain of “all possible machines”,
and is only secondarily interested if informed that some of them
have not yet been made, either by Man or by Nature. What cybernetics offers is the framework on which all individual machines
may be ordered, related and understood.</p>

<p>1/4. Cybernetics, then, is indifferent to the criticism that some of
the machines it considers are not represented among the machines
found among us. In this it follows the path already followed with
obvious success by mathematical physics. This science has long
given prominence to the study of systems that are well known to
be non-existent—springs without mass, particles that have mass
but no volume, gases that behave perfectly, and so on. To say that
these entities do not exist is true; but their non-existence does not
mean that mathematical physics is mere fantasy; nor does it make
the physicist throw away his treatise on the Theory of the Massless Spring, for this theory is invaluable to him in his practical
work. The fact is that the massless spring, though it has no physical representation, has certain properties that make it of the highest importance to him if he is to understand a system even as
simple as a watch.</p>

<p>The biologist knows and uses the same principle when he gives
to Amphioxus, or to some extinct form, a detailed study quite out Of
proportion to its present-day ecological or economic importance.
In the same way, cybernetics marks out certain types of mechanism (S.3/3) as being of particular importance in the general theory; and it does this with no regard for whether terrestrial
machines happen to make this form common. Only after the study
has surveyed adequately the possible relations between machine
and machine does it turn to consider the forms actually found in
some particular branch of science.</p>

<p>1/5. In keeping with this method, which works primarily with the
comprehensive and general, cybernetics typically treats any
given, particular, machine by asking not “what individual act will
it produce here and now?” but “what are all the possible behaviours that it can produce?”</p>

<p>It is in this way that information theory comes to play an essential part in the subject; for information theory is characterised
essentially by its dealing always with a set of possibilities; both its
primary data and its final statements are almost always about the
set as such, and not about some individual element in the set.</p>

<p>This new point of view leads to the consideration of new types
of problem. The older point of view saw, say, an ovum grow into
a rabbit and asked “why does it do this”—why does it not just stay
an ovum?” The attempts to answer this question led to the study
of energetics and to the discovery of many reasons why the ovum
should change—it can oxidise its fat, and fat provides free energy;
it has phosphorylating enzymes, and can pass its metabolises
around a Krebs’ cycle; and so on. In these studies the concept of
energy was fundamental.</p>
<p>Quite different, though equally valid, is the point of view of
cybernetics. It takes for granted that the ovum has abundant free
energy, and that it is so delicately poised metabolically as to be, in
a sense, explosive. Growth of some form there will be; cybernetics
asks “why should the changes be to the rabbit-form, and not to a
dog-form, a fish-form, or even to a teratoma-form?” Cybernetics
envisages a set of possibilities much wider than the actual, and then
asks why the particular case should conform to its usual particular
restriction. In this discussion, questions of energy play almost no
part—the energy is simply taken for granted. Even whether the system is closed to energy or open is often irrelevant; what is important
is the extent to which the system is subject to determining and controlling factors. So no information or signal or determining factor
may pass from part to part without its being recorded as a significant event. Cybernetics might, in fact, be defined as the study of systems that are open to energy but closed to information and
control—systems that are “information-tight” (S.9/19.).</p>

<p>1/6. <em id="uoc">The uses of cybernetics.</em> After this bird’s-eye view of cybernetics we can turn to consider some of the ways in which it promises to be of assistance. I shall confine my attention to the
applications that promise most in the biological sciences. The
review can only be brief and very general. Many applications
have already been made and are too well known to need description here; more will doubtless be developed in the future. There
are, however, two peculiar scientific virtues of cybernetics that
are worth explicit mention.</p>

<p>One is that it offers a single vocabulary and a single set of concepts suitable for representing the most diverse types of system.
Until recently, any attempt to relate the many facts known about,
say, servo-mechanisms to what was known about the cerebellum
was made unnecessarily difficult by the fact that the properties of
servo-mechanisms were described in words redolent of the automatic pilot, or the radio set, or the hydraulic brake, while those of
the cerebellum were described in words redolent of the dissecting
room and the bedside—aspects that are irrelevant to the similarities between a servo-mechanism and a cerebellar reflex. Cybernetics offers one set of concepts that, by having exact
correspondences with each branch of science, can thereby bring
them into exact relation with one other.</p>

<p>It has been found repeatedly in science that the discovery that
two branches are related leads to each branch helping in the development of the other. (Compare S.6/8.) The result is often a markedly accelerated growth of both. The infinitesimal calculus and
astronomy, the virus and the protein molecule, the chromosomes
and heredity are examples that come to mind. Neither, of course,
can give proofs about the laws of the other, but each can give suggestions that may be of the greatest assistance and fruitfulness.
The subject is returned to in S.6/8. Here I need only mention the
fact that cybernetics is likely to reveal a great number of interesting and suggestive parallelisms between machine and brain and
society. And it can provide the common language by which discoveries in one branch can readily be made use of in the others.</p>

<p>1/7. <em>The complex system.</em> The second peculiar virtue of cybernetics is that it offers a method for the scientific treatment of the system in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be
ignored Such systems are, as we well know, only too common in
the biological world!</p>

<p>In the simpler systems, the methods of cybernetics sometimes
show no obvious advantage over those that have long been
known. It is chiefly when the systems become complex that the
new methods reveal their power.</p>
<p>Science stands today on something of a divide. For two centuries
it has been exploring systems that are either intrinsically simple or
that are capable of being analysed into simple components. The fact
that such a dogma as “vary the factors one at a time” could be
accepted for a century, shows that scientists were largely concerned
in investigating such systems as allowed this method; for this
method is often fundamentally impossible in the complex systems.
Not until Sir Donald Fisher’s work in the ’20s, with experiments
conducted on agricultural soils, did it become clearly recognised that
there are complex systems that just do not allow the varying of only
one factor at a time—they are so dynamic and interconnected that
the alteration of one factor immediately acts as cause to evoke alterations in others, perhaps in a great many others. Until recently, science tended to evade the study of such systems, focusing its attention
on those that were simple and, especially, reducible (S.4/14).</p>

<p>In the study of some systems, however, the complexity could
not be wholly evaded. The cerebral cortex of the free-living
organism, the ant-hill as a functioning society, and the human
economic system were outstanding both in their practical importance and in their intractability by the older methods. So today we
see psychoses untreated, societies declining, and economic systems faltering, the scientist being able to do little more than to
appreciate the full complexity of the subject he is studying. But
science today is also taking the first steps towards studying “complexity” as a subject in its own right.</p>

<p>Prominent among the methods for dealing with complexity is
cybernetics. It rejects the vaguely intuitive ideas that we pick up
from handling such simple machines as the alarm clock and the
bicycle, and sets to work to build up a rigorous discipline of the subject. For a time (as the first few chapters of this book will show) it
seems rather to deal with truisms and platitudes, but this is merely
because the foundations are built to be broad and strong. They are
built so that cybernetics can be developed vigorously, without t e
primary vagueness that has infected most past attempts to grapple
with, in particular, the complexities of the brain in action.</p>

<p>Cybernetics offers the hope of providing effective methods for
the study, and control, of systems that are intrinsically extremely
complex. It will do this by first marking out what is achievable
(for probably many of the investigations of the past attempted the
impossible), and then providing generalised strategies, of demonstrable value, that can be used uniformly in a variety of special
cases. In this way it offers the hope of providing the essential
methods by which to attack the ills—psychological, social, economic—which at present are defeating us by their intrinsic complexity. Part III of this book does not pretend to offer such
methods perfected, but it attempts to offer a foundation on which
such methods can be constructed, and a start in the right direction</p>

<h2>PART ONE</h2>
<h3>MECHANISM</h3>
<blockquote>The properties commonly ascribed to any object
are, in last analysis, names for its behavior.<br>
&mdash; Herrick
</blockquote>


<h3 id="change" style="text-align: center">CHANGE</h3>
<hr>
<p>The most fundamental concept in cybernetics is that of “difference”, either that two things are recognisably different or that
one thing has changed with time. Its range of application need not
be described now, for the subsequent chapters will illustrate the
range abundantly. All the changes that may occur with time are
naturally included, for when plants grow and planets age and
machines move some change from one state to another is implicit.
So our first task will be to develop this concept of “change”, not
only making it more precise but making it richer, converting it to
a form that experience has shown to be necessary if significant
developments are to be made.
<p>Often a change occurs continuously, that is, by infinitesimal
steps, as when the earth moves through space, or a sunbather’s
skin darkens under exposure. The consideration of steps that are
infinitesimal, however, raises a number of purely mathematical
difficulties, so we shall avoid their consideration entirely. Instead,
we shall assume in all cases that the changes occur by finite steps
in time and that any difference is also finite. We shall assume that
the change occurs by a measurable jump, as the money in a bank
account changes by at least a penny. Though this supposition may
seem artificial in a world in which continuity is common, it has
great advantages in an Introduction and is not as artificial as it
seems. When the differences are finite, all the important questions, as we shall see later, can be decided by simple counting, so
that it is easy to be quite sure whether we are right or not. Were
we to consider continuous changes we would often have to compare infinitesimal against infinitesimal, or to consider what we
would have after adding together an infinite number of infinitesimals—questions by no means easy to answer.
<p>As a simple trick, the discrete can often be carried over into the
continuous, in a way suitable for practical purposes, by making a
graph of the discrete, with the values shown as separate points. It
is then easy to see the form that the changes will take if the points
were to become infinitely numerous and close together.
<p>In fact, however, by keeping the discussion to the case of the
finite difference we lose nothing. For having established with certainty what happens when the differences have a particular size
we can consider the case when they are rather smaller. When this
case is known with certainty we can consider what happens when
they are smaller still. We can progress in this way, each step being
well established, until we perceive the trend; then we can say what
is the limit as the difference tends to zero. This, in fact, is the
method that the mathematician always does use if he wants to be
really sure of what happens when the changes are continuous.
<p>Thus, consideration of the case in which all differences are
finite loses nothing, it gives a clear and simple foundation; and it
can always be converted to the continuous form if that is desired.
<p>The subject is taken up again in S.3/3.
<br>
  <p>Next, a few words that will have to be used repeatedly. Consider the simple example in which, under the influence of sunshine, pale skin changes to dark skin. Something, the pale skin, is
acted on by a factor, the sunshine, and is changed to dark skin.
That which is acted on, the pale skin, will be called the operand,
the factor will be called the operator, and what the operand is
changed to will be called the transform. The change that occurs,
which we can represent unambiguously by

   $${pale skin → dark skin}$$
    
<p>is the transition.
<p>The transition is specified by the two states and the indication
of which changed to which.

  <hr>
<h3 id="transformation" style="text-align: center">TRANSFORMATION</h3>
<hr>
<p>The single transition is, however, too simple. Experience has
shown that if the concept of “change” is to be useful it must be
enlarged to the case in which the operator can act on more than
one operand, inducing a characteristic transition in each. Thus the
operator “exposure to sunshine” will induce a number of transitions, among which are:

  $${cold \ soil → warm \ soil}$$
 $${unexposed \ photographic \ plate → exposed \ plate}$$
$${coloured \ pigment → bleached \ pigment}$$

  <p>Such a set of transitions, on a set of operands, is a <b>transformation</b>.

<p>Another example of a transformation is given by the simple
coding that turns each letter of a message to the one that follows
it in the alphabet,
Z being turned to A; so CAT would become
DBU. The transformation is defined by the table:

  $${A → B}$$
  $${B → C}$$
  $${…}$$
  $${Y → Z}$$
  $${Z → A}$$
  
<p>Notice that the transformation is defined, not by any reference to
what it “really” is, nor by reference to any physical cause of the
change, but by the giving of a set of operands and a statement of
what each is changed to. The transformation is concerned with
what happens, not with why it happens. Similarly, though we may
sometimes know something of the operator as a thing in itself (as
we know something of sunlight), this knowledge is often not
essential; what we must know is how it acts on the operands; that
is, we must know the transformation that it effects.
<p>For convenience of printing, such a transformation can also be
  expressed thus:





$${\begin{align*}
  \bigg\downarrow  \          &&  A \  B ... Y \ Z \\
  && B \ C … Z \ A \\ 
\end{align*}}$$


  
 <p>We shall use this form as standard.
<p>2/4. Closure. When an operator acts on a set of operands it may
happen that the set of transforms obtained contains no element
  that is not already present in the set of operands, i.e. the transformation creates no new element. Thus, in the transformation


$${\begin{align*}
  \bigg\downarrow  \          &&  A \ B ... Y \ Z \\
  && B \ C … Z \ A \\ 
\end{align*}}$$

  
<p>every element in the lower line occurs also in the upper. When this
occurs, the set of operands is closed under the transformation. The
property of “closure”, is a relation between a transformation and
a particular set of operands; if either is altered the closure may
alter.
<p>It will be noticed that the test for closure is made, not by reference to whatever may be the cause of the transformation but by
reference of the details of the transformation itself. It can therefore be applied even when we know nothing of the cause responsible for the changes. 



  <div style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;"><b>Exercises</b>
    <p style="font-family: Menlo;font-size:10px;">
 <b>Ex. 1:</b> If the operands are the positive integers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the operator is
 “add three to it”, the transformation is:<br>


$${\begin{align*}
  \bigg\downarrow  \          &&  1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \\
  && 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \\ 
\end{align*}}$$

 
Is it closed ?<br>
<b>Ex. 2.</b> The operands are those English letters that have Greek equivalents (i.e.
excluding j, q, etc.), and the operator is “turn each English letter to its Greek
 equivalent”. Is the transformation closed ?<br>

 <b>Ex. 3:</b> Are the following transformations closed or not:<br>

 $${

 <b>Ex. 4:</b> Write down, in the form of Ex. 3, a transformation that has only one operand and is closed.<br>
 <b>Ex. 5:</b> Mr. C, of the Eccentrics’ Chess Club, has a system of play that rigidly prescribes, for every possible position, both for White and slack (except for
those positions in which the player is already mated) what is the player’s best
next move. The theory thus defines a transformation from position to position. On being assured that the transformation was a closed one, and that C
always plays by this system, Mr. D. at once offered to play C for a large
stake. Was D wise?<br>
