# matteodimaio.net

This is the personal website/wiki of Matteo Di Maio. All of the static files are hosted here (thanks Github) throurough Pages. 

If you want to get in touch, I'm @echronocom on Twitter and @enochthechronocom@mstdn.social on the Fediverse. You can email me at me@matteodimaio.net, with my PGP key on my website under /Contact. 

The plan is for my website to include nicely-formatted:

- code / programming workbook solutions
- essays on philosophy, classics, critical theory
- self experiments and analysis 
- interesting links and tidbits from the interwbeb
