	<p>An alternative way to think about the Fake News story the liberal world is telling itself, as per <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/09/bad-news-selling-the-story-of-disinformation/">Harper's Magazine:</a></p>
	<blockquote>One reason to grant Silicon Valley’s assumptions about our mechanistic persuadability is that it prevents us from thinking too hard about the role we play in taking up and believing the things we want to believe. It turns a huge question about the nature of democracy in the digital age—what if the people believe crazy things, and now everyone knows it?—into a technocratic negotiation between tech companies, media companies, think tanks, and universities. But there is a deeper and related reason many critics of Big Tech are so quick to accept the technologist’s story about human persuadability. As the political scientist Yaron Ezrahi has noted, the public relies on scientific and technological demonstrations of political cause and effect because they sustain our belief in the rationality of democratic government. Indeed, it’s possible that <em>the Establishment needs the theater of social-media persuasion to build a political world that still makes sense, to explain Brexit and Trump and the loss of faith in the decaying institutions of the West.</em> The ruptures that emerged across much of the democratic world five years ago called into question the basic assumptions of so many of the participants in this debate—the social-media executives, the scholars, the journalists, the think tankers, the pollsters. A common account of social media’s persuasive effects provides a convenient explanation for how so many people thought so wrongly at more or less the same time.

<h2 id="trolley-problem"> Emotional algorithms </h2>
	<hr>
<p>Elizier Yudkowsky has always talked about the picture of rationality as analogous to emotion as a wrong one; once we have determined the most rational course of action, we should feel strongly about it. I'd argue for a new classification &mdash; emotions are just rationality 1.0; biochemical algorithms honed to make the most rational decision given the African savannah approximately 1 mya. This logic extends to theories of consciousness. The ability to feel is just a rudimentary consequence of evolutionary rationality. To expect  artificial intelligences &mdash; without natural selection and with the advantages of intelligence human design &mdash; to develop consiousness in the human sense is to expect them to regress to a more primitive decision making algorithm. </p>
<p>The problem of course with seeing emotions as outdated logic &mdash; something easily biochemically manipulated &mdash; is that most of our secular moral calculus is based on the principles of pleasure maximization and pain minimization. Imagine a cyborg human from 2084. This human wears a brain-computer interface. The interface connects by Bluetooth to their phone. Just like the humans in 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep,' this human can choose to 'dial up' any emotion they'd like. Punch the code '1654' and you get mild discomfort, punch '5963' and you get extreme nerves, punch '4523' and you get euphoria. Now imagine this human in this transhumanist future can control these emotions through a brain interface, as well.  </p>
<p>So this human finds themself at a trolly cart intersection, standing next to a big lever. A trolly cart is hurtling down the tracks, set to run over five people, tied down. That human can pull the lever, which will switch the trolly over to another set of tracks, on which only one person is tied. What do they do? The consequentialist utilitarian calculus is: minimize pain and maximize pleasure. So you pull the lever. But suppose you can gesture to either the five people or the one person. You say: "dial a 5633 &mdash; total loss of human emotion for five minutes." Now you can run either the five or the one person over, and neither will feel a thing. Perhaps afterwards, you 3D print them all new bodies and upload Thursday's memory iCloud backup.  </p>
<p> Another problem: how do we justify any kind of human-specialness when intelligence &mdash; supposedly our greatest quality &mdash; is better expressed in artificial substrates? We could say that intelligence is not what makes humans special, that would be our emotional capacity. And yet by that logic humans are no different from any of the other reasonably sentient animals on this earth.  </p>
<p> These problems are part of the reason I think society should be able to recommend "philosophy" more vigoursouly as a subject of study and a future career. "What are you going to do with that liberal arts degree, eh?" used to be a jaunt. Now you can say: "Well, I'll just earn $200,000 a year <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/openai/jobs/4050249004">working at OpenAI.</a>"  </p>

<h2 id="paying-people-to-vote-wisely"> Paying people to vote for good policies.</h2>
<hr>
<p>A possibly workable idea to improve the quality of our politics, based off the fundamental premise that we are better at deciding as a <em>demos</em> whether a policy was good or not in retrospect than we are at deciding whether a policy will be good in the future. Thus, every five to ten years after a government institutes a policy/set of policies, everyone in the country votes on whether they were good or not. If they are found “good” with a high majority—say 70%—everyone who voted for them gets paid. We could fund this with a prediction market, whereby the government sells shares in whether or not the policy will be found good, and uses the returns to reward the voters in five/ten years. This should have the intended effect of making everyone do a bit more research into the policies they are voting for.

How do we manage this without giving up voter anonymity? Probably cryptographic digital voting, something along the lines of what <a href=“https://www.proquest.com/openview/05248eca4597fec343d8b46cb2bef724/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y“>Benaloh 1987</a> proposed. Five years after the fact, you cryptographically sign a message confirming you own the key that, according to the public anonymous voting ledger, originally authorized the favorable policy.

  <p>Per Jess Whittlestone at <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/10/9188517/political-bias">Vox</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we have strong social incentives to defend our groups' political beliefs, we have very little incentive to form _accurate_ political beliefs. Most people acknowledge that political issues are incredibly important for society as a whole, but as individuals we’re not necessarily rewarded for how rational and truth-seeking we are about politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the contrast between our beliefs about politics and our beliefs about the physical environment immediately around us. If I believe that the pavement ahead of me is clear and I’m wrong — there’s actually a lamppost in my path, say — I’m going to quickly suffer as a result of my false belief. This gives me a clear incentive to form accurate beliefs about the physical environment immediately around me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The same logic doesn’t apply in politics. If I believe that immigration to my country from other countries is harmful, that false belief doesn’t harm me directly. Even if I vote in an election based on that belief, the chances of my belief actually affecting the outcome of the election are so slim that a poorly chosen vote is unlikely to hurt me personally.</p>

<h1 id="tea">Tea</h1>
<hr/>
<blockquote>Its liquor is like the sweetest dew of Heaven</blockquote>
  <blockquote>- Lu Yu.</blockquote>
<p>Tea once made a brief and pretty bizarre appearance in my long list of childhood fads--encompassing everything from Lord of the Rings to Claymation--sometime around the ages of 8-12. I was fascinated by the process--I remember watching YouTube videos of tea preparation with great focus. Being an English household, however, Earl Grey was the only drinking option avaible. Not knowing that all varieties of tea are made from the same bush--*Camellia sinensis*--young me set about picking, rolling, and pan-firing some bay-leaves from the garden. The result, predictably, was some very-much-not-green water with bits of charred bay leaves floating in it. </p>
<p>Now a semi-seasoned green and chai tea drinker, I returned to my old obsession this August after reading Mary Lou Heiss' *The Story of Tea*. The book is pretty all-encompassing; it ranges from a poetic history of the Tea-Horse trade route between the states of the Eurasian steppe, to a detailed discussion of the scientific manufacture processes of each tea style, to a breakdown of the key Organic regulatory certifications. </p>
<p>I was most interested in the history of the beverage. Tea was first consumed in the "vast nexus" of the Assam in northeastern India, and the Yunnan of southwestern China. China, however, is tea's verifiable birthplace. Interestingly, some anthropologists speculate that the first humans to venture out of Africa--Homo erectus--may have discovered the indigenous tea trees of the Yunnan, from curiosity or from mimicking the animals of the area, and ultimately discovering the caffeinating properties of the plant. At least by the Shang dynasty (1766-1050BCE), tea was being consumed for its medicinal properties, and, by the Zhou dynasty (1122-256BCE), tea leaves were being boiled exclusively in hot water. At this point in history, tea became not just an ingredient in the herbal concoctions of early humans, but an invigorating yet bitter drink in its own right. </p>
<p>Tea began its journey as a product of export in 641 CE, when the Tang Princess Wen Chong married the Tibetan king Songstan Gambo and brought tea with her from Sichuan to Tibet. Thus began an trade exchange between the Tibetans and the Tang court that would last untill the 1260s; the Tang wanted strong horses for their militaries, while the Tibetans needed tea as a break from their mundane diet. These exchanges were known as the 'Tea-horse' routes, and stretched from Sichuan and Yunnan to Tibet over the Himalayas. </p>
<p> Tea entered Japan in 815 through the returning priest Saichō, who supposedly served it to the Emperor. By the sixteenth century Japanese tea culture had become a thing of its own with the establishment of Chanoyu, or the way of the tea. During the Manchu period, the Dutch established a trading base in modern Jakarta on the island of Java, from where they purchased tea from China. The lengthy sea trips from the east to the west had the effect of instigating the West's infatuation with black or oxidized tea--to survive the voyage, the Chinese realized they had to allow the tea leaf to darken, before being bake fried. In 1610 the first tea shipment reached The Hague, and from their tea took off amongst the European elite. By 1658 tea was being bought in London, and by 1669, England had sanctioned the English East India Company with a monopoly on trade in the East. The growing English addiction to tea was not met by indirect purchases from the Dutch, and it wasn't long before the English had gone to war over tea (The Opium Wars), before establishing plantations in India, now a tea powerhouse. </p>
<h4 id="interesting-tea-facts"> Interesting tea facts </h4>

<li>The Chinese have two words for *Camellia sinensis.* Speakers in the eastern port of Xiamen pronouced the character for tea *te*, while speakers in the southern ports of Canton (now Guangzhou) pronouced it as *cha* or *ch'a*; *cha* is now the dominant Cantonese and Mandarin pronouciation. The legacy of these two ports is in the words for tea in the languages of all those countries who bought from china. Thus:</li>

<li>all variations of tea--black, white, green, oolong--are made from variations of the same plant, <em>Camellia sinensis</em>. Where they differ is manufacturing process and levels of oxidation.</li>
<li>The British had little luck cultivating tea in India at first, both from lack of clippings and lack of expertise; meanwhile, the Chinese were famously secretive and protective of their methods.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1848, ..., the English hired the Scottish botanist Robert Fortune to dress as a Chinese businessman and go undercover in Fujian Province with the intent of collecting tea plants and learning the CHinese processes for manufacturing both green and black tea. With the help of Chinese accomplishes Fortune's subterfuge was successful. He returned triumphant, with smuggled tea cuttings, technical information, and more than eighty Chinese tea specialists who were ready to put their knowledge to work in India. The sesequent bushes propagated from cuttings and seeds he smuggled out of China numbered more than twenty thousand plants.</p>

<p><em><b>Is moral philosophy masquerading as religion in its claim to have universal laws of morality?</b></em></p>

</span>
</p>

<blockquote>These leading ideas – of rational action, of the value of happiness, and of achieving the best that our nature affords – are grand ideas. In their grandeur, they can once again remind us of some of religion’s grand ideas. For example: that the evil of the world is explained by the possibility of redeeming it by the sacrifice of an innocent God. Or that we are absolutely predestined to hell or to heaven, yet must strive to act as if what we do could change that. And very much like the debates over those theological topics, the debates among the foundations of morality are irredeemably insoluble.</blockquote>

<p>Of course, utilitarianism has its flaws--how to solve the direct opposition of pain and pleasure, how to quantify these occurances in a cost/benefit analysis?</p> 

<p>The categorical imperative goes a long way to curtailing the evils of Moloch.... </p> 

<p>Likewise, all three secular moral lenses ignore the fact that pain and pleasure are not homogenous--one man's pain is indeed another man's pleasure. </p> 

<p>Hitchens said we all had a universal morality backed into the human genome --egalitarianism seems to be a survival advantage, at least of a selfish, human only kind. </p> 

<p>Where do we look? Not to intuition. </p> 

<blockquote>When feeling bound by a moral rule in that special way, the rule’s transgression, by oneself or others, is liable to trigger ‘moral’ emotions such as guilt or indignation. A Nazi might feel indignant at his colleague’s lack of zeal in persecuting Jews. A fundamentalist jihadist might feel guilty for secretly teaching his daughter to read. Deciding between good and bad moralities will once again lead to a wild-goose chase after foundations.</blockquote>

<p>I mean, we care about morality in a secular way because... why exactly? It's *useful*? Useful for [insert maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain]? </p> 

<p>Where does guilt come from? It can hardly be universal in application. </p> 

<p>Should moral decisions loose their special value? Maybe we can just have *reasons*, not moral reasons... </p>

    <p>From Reddit, I don’t remember where:</p>

<blockquote>The way echo chambers work seems to be popularly mis-explained. How’s it’s explained: everyone you encounter agrees with you. How it actually works: everyone you encounter who you disagree with appears to be insane or evil. Next time you encounter someone who disagrees with you, you expect them to be insane or evil, causing you to act in a way that seems to them to be insane or evil. </blockquote>

    <p>It is ironic that we find it so hard to love or empathize with artificial/made things, in spite of our assertion that a human coming about without God in the equation is a equivalent to teaching kids they are "mindless animals."
