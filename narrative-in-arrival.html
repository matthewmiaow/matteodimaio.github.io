<p><em>Temporal consciousness in Arrival and Blink </em></p>
<hr/>
<p>| <em>meta</em> <br/>
|  <em>Very much in progress • Review • Critical Theory • Film </em>  |</p>
<hr/>




  <p><b><em>Abstract:</em></b>  Denis Villeneuve's <em>Arrival</em>  (2016) and Steven Moffat’s <em>Blink</em> (2007) offer new perspectives on key aspects of formal narratology, particularly the relationship between narrative (syuzhet) and story (fabula), in which story is considered to be the linear, temporally monodirectional "raw material" of the media product ("just one damn thing after another"), and where narrative is a creative cutting, pasting, shortening and reordering of this raw material for engagement or stylistic purposes. In Arrival, narrative--the order of scenes presented to the audience--is more intrinsically crucial to the themes of the film, and is actually the director's attempt to represent subjectively new kinds of xenopsychology ("alien" notions of consciousness), with connections to both theoretical physics and the debate over linguistic relativity. The film's narrative communicates the teleological consciousness of the visiting aliens; in doing so, it forces us and Dr Banks to grapple with the ideas of causality and inevitability, which can be interpreted through lenses of Zen Buddhism or Western Stoicism. Blink is additionally unique in that its temporal manipulation is an example of “de-conceiting”, in which Baudry’s idea of the “ideological cinematic apparatus” is uncloaked through the text’s preoccupation with movement that happens within the characters’ and the audiences’ blinks. The text additionally becomes anamorphic, in which the personal linear storylines of the characters are at constant risk of reshaping. <p>

<hr>
<h2>The material Real in Blink</h2>

<p>The three temporal aspects of filmic narratives—temporal duration, temporal frequency and temporal order—are crucial to a cohesive media product. At its heart, temporal duration can be reduced to the single photographic frame, played one after another 24 times a second. This creates what is a fundamental cinematic illusion—that the text reflects time in the ‘Real’. There are other illusions; the temporal duration of the film obviously does not line up with the temporal duration of the fictional “story”; elements are cut to reduce boredom. And yet, we presuppose that a film is a live action representation of happenings. </p>

<p> Blink indirectly interrogates several of the key narrative features that construct this temporal illusion of forward narrative progression. </p>

<p> The film presupposes its own duplicitous realism. It was Jean-Louis Baudry who wrote of the “cinematic apparatus” that it “conceals its work and imposes an idealist ideology, rather than producing critical awareness in a spectator.” The cinematic apparatus takes what can be considered “objective reality” (what is filmed) synthesising it through the intermediary (the camera) to the finished product the audience decodes (a reconstructed yet false version of this original objective reality.) Baudry additionally notes that cinema is essentially a collection of still frames—the differences between the frames, paradoxically, creates the illusion of continuity; of narrative time. In cinema, the only actual temporal movement of characters on the screen is subconscious. Thus, Baudry’s observation becomes porto-Freudian, in that it sees a similarity between the continous-discontinous language of the “unconscious mind” as manifested in our dreams and hallucinations, and the illusion that is narrative film. As Baudry summarises: </p>
 
<blockquote>“Thus one may assume that what was already at work as the originating basis of the persepective image, namely the eye, the “subject”, is put forth, liberated by the operation which transforms successive, discrete images (as isolated images they have, strictly speaking, no meaning, or at least no unity of meaning) into continuity, movement, meaning; with continuity restored both meaning and consciousness are restored.”</blockquote>

<p> In Blink, a sci-fi-horror cross-over, the monsters are the “weeping angels.” As the Doctor explains, what appears as stone statues are really aliens from another planet. These aliens have evolved an extraordinarily effective defence mechanism—they can only move when they are not observed; when seen, they turn to stone. Thus, for the episode’s protagonists, the “blink”—a necessary human action—becomes what stands between life and death. To close one’s eyes is to allow, if only for a millisecond, the movement of the predatory angels. The angels become the embodiment of the static cinematic frame; the nature of their villainy reminds the viewer that the illusion of movement in film happens only in the unconscious moment between still frames. Remember that Baudry noted that “breakdowns in the recreation of movement” bring the audience back to “the body… the technical apparatus which he or she had forgotten”.  Any reminder of the ultimate discontinuity of film breaks the cinematic illusion, thus reminding the viewer of the materiality of film. </p>

<p> Blink—as “meta-fiction”—pursues this is idea of the faulty optical apparatus the audience brings to film. Any manner of technological difficulties can suspend the cinematic illusion—the theatre’s projection, the frame rate, the applied “syuzhet” (that is, the director’s choice of scenes to include, obviously a shortening of reality that must be disguised). But perhaps the most important, if under-studied, is the eye itself. Every time we blink we remove ourself from the narrative—a temporary moment of blackness. We tend to see this moment of blackness as a loss, in which on-screen action is missed. Blink, through the characters of the Weeping Angels, reminds us that this internal moment is actually where all the movement occurs; in our minds. </p>

<p> Consider the final scene of the episode, in which Larry must hold off the angels by suspending his need to blink. This scene prompts a visceral interaction with the audience—we too strain our eyes, holding off that moment of disassociation from the narrative of the film that might hold the crucial turning point; the attack of the angels. The irony of Moffat’s monster is that what ever we wish to see—the movement of the angels—can in principle never be seen. To see an angel would be to “quantum lock” or freeze it. Thus, the weeping angel is both an effective horror tool, and a meta-comment on the paradoxical nature of film itself; knitting together 24 frames into a linear temporal “arrow of time” is done not by the director but by the viewer—cinema is a creature of Freud’s unconscious. </p>

<p> This fascination with the action of the eye—the blink—applies another narrative concept to “Blink”: that of the anamorphic moment. Blink, being a Doctor Who episode and thus a staple of the time-travel sub-genre, is obviously a non-linear narrative. One view of cinema is that narrative can be visualized as a twirling string of independent threads; each thread representing the separate linear lives of each individual character in a grand narrative. Blink takes this view, isolating each individual character’s storyline. While the presentation of scenes on screen in Blink occurs in a linear fashion, sequentially, and in the chronological “present”, each individual sub-narrative isn’t fixed; as the Angels attack, each character’s relative position in the main chronology is shifted backwards. The “blink”—in this case the closure of the character’s eyes, and a static cut in terms of editing—is the so-called “anamorphic” moment, in which the audience’s view of the media product is radically altered. </p>

<p> Remember, the Weeping Angels are immobilized by your sight; only in darkness or when you close your eyes can they attack, killing you in what the Doctor describes as a “nice” way: transporting their victims back in time, “feeding” on their “temporal energy”, while the person gets to live out their life in a different time. Ironically, the moment they could have killed you in the present is still the moment of your death; you simply die of old age, having lived a whole life up until this moment. </p>

<p> At the beginning of the episode, Kathy is with Sally in the old house, until the Weeping Angels thrust her back to 1920. The moment of thrust is a blink; Kathy closing her eyes in the story, but also the editing—the black bar that covers the screen—forcing the audience ourselves to blink. This is an anamorphic moment, in that the chronology is immediately reshaped by Kathy’s pushback in time. The episode “recalibrates,” in essence. The same thing happens to DI Billy Shipton, thrust from the temporal “present” back to 1969. Interestingly, this is not so much a non-linear narrative presentation but a non-linearity of the individual story-lines, stressing their narrative uniqueness. From the moment Kathy is thrust back she is also in the present, just as a long dead woman. Likewise, DI Shipton becomes an old man at his deathbed. Each moment of blinking becomes a potential for the individual narrative strings to re-weave themselves, which keeps the audience in a constant state of guessing. </p>

<h2>Temporal dissasociation in Arrival </h2>

<blockquote>The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there—but why is the past so different from the [future](https://complexob7.com/the-future-of-military-tech/ "Future")? Why do we remember the past, but not the future?”</blockquote>
<p>- L. P. Hartley</p>

<p>Arrival is a 2016 sci-fi blockbuster directed by Denis Villeneuve, based on Ted Chiang's short novella "Story of Your Life." In America, the US military hires linguist Dr. Louise Banks to decipher the curious inkish graphmes the aliens communicate with. The graphemes--termed "Heptapod B"--are gradually decoded by Dr Banks, who soon becomes proficent in the language. In a radical interpretation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis--the centre of linguistic relativity, in which language is purported to shape elements of consciousness and thought in humans--Heptapod B gives Dr. Banks seemingly prophetic powers; this ability to see the future allows her to prevent a Chinese war with the aliens, but also forces her to grapple with the inevitable death of her yet unborn child. </p>

<p> Ted Chiang's short story and Arrival both deal with the cracking of the Heptapod B code in different levels of complexity. Heptapod B consists of swiriling ink taxograms, which Dr. Banks concludes are sesmasiographic. Efforts to decode the language, however, stall. In the short story, physicist Dr. Gary Donnelly's explanation of Fermat's Principle of Least Time provides the inspiration Dr. Banks needs. Fermat posited that a ray of light travelling between two given points will always take the path that can be traveled in the least time. Dr. Banks realises that "a ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in." In both the short story and the film, the understanding of Heptapod B Dr. Banks lands on is that Heptapods construct their sentences simultaneously; like optical rays, they know where they are going before they start. In terms of linguistic relativity, this conception of writing is reflective of the Heptapod xenopsychology, in which they experience time not as a linear causality but as a simultaneous teleology.  In the film, it is suggested that the Heptapods will need humanity's help in "3000 years", thus they have given their language to humanity now to establish ties. As Dr. Banks learns Heptapod B, she grows to see time like the Heptapods do.  </p>

<p> Narrative studies has inherited the terms "fabula" and "syuzhet" from Russian formalism; the terms where first employed by Vladimir Propp and Viktor Shklovsky. In essence, "fabula" is the raw material of a story, while "syuzhet" is the intentional reshaping of that linear chronology for effect--to build suspense, and to create meaning. (Culler 1981) The twin dynamics of narrative and story are crucial to the understanding of meaning in texts. In films specifically, the limited running time of the media places extra importance on syuzhet to compress the fabula. Non-linear conventions like flash-forwards and flash-backs are widely used to drip feed information to audiences, building tension; they also establish causality and intention.  </p>

<p> In Arrival, the audience's subjective prior experience of narrative structure in films leads us to interpret the oneiric, yellow-tinted scenes of Dr. Banks and her dying daughter that interupt the main chronology as "flashbacks" to a painful past memory. This technological code is consistent; Villenaue uses warm colors to delineate the dream sequences from the rest of the narrative (which uses cooler tones.) This creates what could be called "temporal dissonance", and is immediately indentifable as post-traumatic consciousness. But this interpretation of the narrative structure gradually unravells. Perhaps the key epiphany is a scene in which Dr. Bank's child is scribbling drawings on the wall; one of them resembles the amophorous seven-legged aliens--the child comes *after* the arrival of the Heptapods. As Arrival's narrative progresses, then, we realise that Dr. Banks has not yet even conceived.  </p>

<p> But while the jaundiced "flashforwards" are out of linear time in a strict sense, they are very much *present* in terms of being Dr. Bank's own contemporary subjective experience, inspired by her learning of Heptapod B. Which this temporal perspective, the dictum of causality dissapates. In other words, her daughter has not been born and yet certainly *will* be born. Like a ray of light, time progresses monodirectionally, but its end point is certain. With this knowledge, time can be seen as a simultaneaity of happenings.  </p>

<p>"Premonitions" does not seem to be the right word for the visions in Arrival--it does not accurately grasp that Dr. Bank's dream sequences are not glimpses of the future but instead a sign of the future and past and present de-linearising. We see this in the cross-time temporal paradoxes that arrive towards the end of the film. In one scene, Dr. Banks is asked by her young daughter what the technical term ("no, more science-y") for a win-win situation. At first Dr. Banks is stumped. Back in the "present", the game theoretic term "zero-sum game" comes up in the context of the Chinese's military maneuveres. As the narrative shifts us back once more to the future scene, Dr. Banks can now confidently tell her daughter that the term is "zero sum game." Another example is when, in order to advert a Chinese attack on the Heptapods, Dr. Banks calls the Chinese general on his personal phone, mentioning to him the last words of his dead wife. Stunned, he calls off the attack. It is only much later, at an international conference celebrating said adversion that the general whispers those words to Dr. Banks. While these scenes are commonly interpreted as time-travel, however, the narrative structure of Arrival instead aims to establish a new mode of temporal consciousness, drawing inspirations from theorectical physics and the Sapir-Whorf school of linguistics. (Branwen 2018). As the British literary scholar Bran Nicol argues, it might be more accurate to refer to this film as “humanities fiction” than "science fiction", such as that it is a social science that wins the day, likewise; the narrative is less about "time machines" and more about temporal philosophy.  </p>

<p> Time is a "wibbly-wobbly, slimey-wimey" thing. Slimey, particularly, in that it seems to slip away from any definate explanation. Theories of time continue to evolve. In 1927, the British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington (most likely) coined the phrase "arrow of time".  The concept attempts to articulate what is an obvious phenomena to us: "time moves forward but not back". The late Stephen Hawking expanded the definition to three kinds of temporal 'arrows'. First: the thermodynamic arrow--in which entropy always increases as time progresses; entropy is irreversable, in that you can smash a wine glass on the floor easily, putting it back together is a lot harder. Second: the psychological arrow of time--this is the directionality in which we remember the past but not the future. (Subject to socio-cultural effects, perhaps, as will be explored later.) Third: the cosmological arrow of time; the universe is always expanding, from a singularity of ultimate compression towards ultimate heat death.  </p>

<p> Then along came Einstein with his definition of "space-time"--a four-dimensional fabric on which everything exists. Theoretically, space-time should allow for navigation in all four of its dimensions. In space-time, time does not "flow", but rather "is".  Our perception of it is thus an allusion; one that--perhaps---the telological thinking of the Heptapods could break. A clever demonstration of this comes from Marvel, in one of the later Agents of Shield episodes. The archtypical scientist "Fitz" lays a stack of a4 paper on the table. He traces his finger up the sheets, explaining how a being adapted to live on one sheet would perceive moving up the sheets as directional flow. In reality, a being that graps all three dimensions would see that the stack is set in place. </p>

<p> The interesting thing about the physics of time is that quantum processes seem to be entirely "time-symetric"; they work just the same moving towards the past as towards the future. As Wikipedia summarises: "if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true." Indeed, there is a rather strange theoretical particle in physics called the tachyon that routinely travels faster than light--appearing to us to be travelling backwards in time, violating the Newtonian laws of cause and effect. In a nod to this concept of temporal-symmetry, Dr. Banks, towards the end of the film, explains that the name of her daughter--Hannnah--is a palindrome; a word that remains the same regardless of whether it is written backwards or forwards. As such, it has no beginning or end.  </p>

<p> Gwern Branwen summarises these strains of thought, in the context of Story of My Life: </p>

<blockquote>...classical physics allows usefully interpreting the laws of physics in both a ‘forward’ way in which events happen step by step, but also a teleological way in which events are simply the unique optimal solution to a set of constraints including the outcome and allows reasoning ‘backwards’. The alien race exemplifies this other, equally valid, possible way of thinking and viewing the universe, and the protagonist learns their way of thinking by studying their language, which requires seeing written characters as a unified gestalt. </blockquote>

<p> The unique narrative structure of Arrival--in which narrative cutting and pasting moments out of the general linear chronology serves the purpose of describing the equally unique temporal consciousness of the Heptapods--leads into an interesting discussion surrounding "xenopsychology". In other words, the psychology of alien minds. In 1984, Robert A Freitas introduced the term and the field of theoretical psychology. Science fiction films like Arrival have been crucial to this speculative exploration of modes of consciousness.  </p>

<p> Dr. Bernard Aaronson, at Princeton, has been a pioneer in experimental subjective temporal psychology. In one experiment, he gave posthypnotic suggestions to human subjects, testing their reactions to expanded or contracted time frames, such as: "Do you know how we divide time into the three categories of past, present, and future? When I wake you, the future will be gone. There will be no future." Subjects given these "timeless" suggestions reportedly experienced loss of identity and a "profound euphoric mystical sensation." One subject remarked that he "found himself in a boundless, immanent present." Other psychological impacts were a loss of fear of death.  </p>

<p> Contemporary linguistics suggests a link between anatomy and ideas of time; with some culturally determined variation. In english, for example, the past is "behind" while the future is "ahead". The Aymara language takes the opposing view-"ahead" is the past while "behind" is the future, corresponding, naturally, to the future being unobservable. In a simmilar fashion, the Chinese are known to gesture forward for the past and behind for the future. Cultural relativism extends to religious thought: the Kabbalah, a Jewish esoteric sect, consider time to be a paradox--both the future and the past are combined in a simultaneous present. In no known culture, however, does the future become "right" and the past "left". The Hetapods, in their radical symmetry--each limb is indistinguishable from the other--are perhaps an application of this theory. To them, any direction could be "forward." Their ligatures are read without linear direction. It only follows then, that their perception of time would be simmilar.  </p>

<p> Specifically in Arrival, however, the fixed nature of the future creates moral confrontation. Arrival's narrative blends jaundiced "future" scenes with the cooler tones of the present; and yet we have Dr. Banks kissing--for the first time--her soon-to-be husband Ian even as she watches them argue, and break up, their daughter live and laugh and die, all in one. Their are two possible implications of seeing time as the Heptapods do--fabula collapsing into pure syuzhet. One is to descend into nihilism. We say we cannot remember the future. And yet surely we know we will live, and die, and laugh and suffer. The other, inspired perhaps by concepts in Buddhism and Stoicism, is to see new temporal consciousness as a form of "enlightenment"--a radical interpretation of the dictum that life goes on without you; you can embrace it or not.  </p>

<p> This seems to be the line Dr. Banks takes. Collapsing at one point into Ian's arms, the mise-en-scene fades into the a future moment; Dr. Banks with her daughter: </p>

<blockquote>LOUISE: Well, believe it or not, I know something that’s going to happen. I can’t explain how I know, I just do, and when I told your daddy, he got really mad. And he said I made the wrong choice.<br>

HANNAH: What? What’s going to happen?<br>
 
LOUISE: It has to do with a really rare disease, and it’s unstoppable. Kind of like you
are, with your swimming, and your poetry, and all the other amazing things that you
share with the world. <br>

HANNAH: I am unstoppable?<br>

LOUISE: Yeah. <br></blockquote>

<p> Well isn't this an ideal example of the twin ways we can take the idea of narrative "inevitability"?  </p>

<p> In Mahayana Buddhism, there is a concept called Pratītyasamutpāda. It describes the "mutual identity and mutual intercausality" of phenomena. Through this lens, the Heptapods become a source of a certain kind of more *human* enlightenment for Dr. Banks, in which she experiences a seemingly paradoxical engagement in the present, juxtaposed against an awareness of the whole future. (Luca Zanchi 2020) In other Buddhist schools, the world is seen to be ending and beginning a thousand times a second. Indeed, it is later that Dr. Banks, in narration, declares that “despite knowing the journey and where it leads, I embrace it, and I welcome every moment of it.” </p>

<p>Thus Arrival's narrative structure can be both a piece of theoretical science and theoretical philosophy. While Buddhism and Stocisim--like Dr. Banks--suggest a radically indifference towards the complicatedness of temporal causality, physics finds itself reaffirming the empirical basis to these world-views. Likewise, our concept of "time" is not static; it differs across languages and cultures, and--perhaps--anatomies. In the same way, narrative theory is itself evolving with the passing of that wobbly-wobbly, slimey-wimey thing called *time.* </p>



<hr>
  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
  <p>I will now consider Blink and Arrival’s narrative structure and effect comparatively. </p>
<p>A key reading to revisit is that Arrival can be considered “humanities fiction” as opposed to science fiction. That is to say, Arrival’s hero is not an astronaut but a linguist; while its narrative temporality is non-linear and superficially links to the idea of time travel, it is really about time travel as a linguistic/xenopsychological perspective. The vehicle for non-linearity is not a hyperdrive or a flux capacitor but instead the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. As such, we can read the narrative devices like flashbacks in the film through a predominately philosophical lens; an exploration of how time changes as language and perspective changes.</p>

<p>Blink, in contrast, is squarely within the traditionally sci-fi interpretation of non-linear narratives. Its characters really do re-align themselves on the cosmic space time; magical monsters are the cause. This is not to say, however, that Blink’s non-linearity is shallow. When we consider the film through Baudry’s theory of the cinematic apparatus, the very idea of forward narrative progression itself is interrogated—Blink reminds us of the fundamentally static materiality of film, and of the crucial role of what is really a optical illusion in conveying narrative meaning on screen. When we apply another narrative lens—that of the subplot—Blink begins to explore the idea of “anamorphic text”. Like a holographic card, a shift in angle reveals a whole new perspective on the image. Likewise, each moment of time travel is an anamorphic moment for Blink’s characters, and their individual narratives. The fundamental idea beneath their “re-shuffling” within the wider narrative is that narrative is a product of its parts: the age and relative positions of its separate characters can deconstruct and reconstruct a story.</p>
